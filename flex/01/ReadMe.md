### Center This Div: Mastering Flexbox Alignment

In this exercise, provided by [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/intro-to-css), I practiced one of the most common and essential tasks in web development: centering an element using CSS. Specifically, I used flexbox to center a red div within a blue container.

### What I Did:
1. Applied flexbox properties to the blue container element to center the red div both horizontally and vertically.  
2. Ensured that only flexbox was used for alignment, without relying on other CSS methods or workarounds.

### What I Learned:
- **Flexbox Basics**: This exercise reinforced my understanding of flexbox, specifically how to use properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` to achieve perfect centering.
  
- **Efficient Centering**: I learned how flexbox simplifies the process of centering elements, making it an invaluable tool for layouts.

- **Precision and Simplicity**: By focusing only on flexbox for this task, I developed a cleaner and more efficient approach to solving layout problems.

### Reflection:
Although this was a simple exercise, it addressed a fundamental skill that Iâ€™ll use frequently in web development. Mastering this technique will save time and effort when building layouts, ensuring elements are consistently and cleanly positioned.
