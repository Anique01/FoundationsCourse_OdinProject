### An Entire Page: Structuring with Flexbox

This exercise, provided by [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/intro-to-css), introduced me to using flexbox for laying out an entire webpage. It focused on creating a structure with a header, footer, and a main content area, all aligned and spaced correctly using flexbox techniques.

### What I Did:
1. **Page Layout with Flexbox**: Used flexbox to structure the webpage, ensuring the header stayed at the top, the footer stuck to the bottom, and the content remained centered in the viewport.  
2. **Styling Links and Lists**: Removed bullet points from lists and styled links to remove the default underline.  
3. **Header and Footer Styling**: Added padding to the header and footer and aligned the links within them to opposite sides, creating a clean and functional layout.  
4. **Content Centering**: Centered the logo, input field, and buttons vertically and horizontally in the main content area, with adequate spacing between elements.

### Challenge:
- **Centering the Content**: Initially, I struggled to center the main content properly. I resolved this by applying a flex display to the `body` and setting the flex direction to `column`. This allowed me to align everything vertically and horizontally with ease.

### What I Learned:
- **Full-Page Layouts with Flexbox**: This exercise deepened my understanding of how to use flexbox to create a complete webpage layout, not just individual components.  
- **Body as a Flex Container**: Using the `body` as a flex container with `height: 100vh` made it easy to control the overall structure and align elements dynamically.  
- **Removing Default Styles**: I practiced customizing default styles, such as removing list bullets and link underlines, to achieve a polished appearance.  
- **Spacing and Padding**: Learned to balance spacing and padding across different sections to maintain a clean, professional layout.

### Reflection:
This exercise demonstrated how flexbox simplifies the process of creating responsive and well-structured webpage layouts. By overcoming the challenge of centering content, I gained confidence in using the `body` as a flex container and managing alignment and spacing effectively. These skills are invaluable for building user-friendly, visually appealing web designs.
