    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A comforting and flavorful Mexican classic with tender chicken wrapped in corn tortillas, covered in a rich red sauce, and topped with melted cheese.</p>
    <p>Enchiladas are a beloved Mexican dish that features soft corn tortillas filled with a variety of ingredients, typically shredded meat, cheese, or beans, and then rolled up and smothered in a rich, flavorful sauce. The sauce, often made from red chilies, tomatoes, and spices, gives the enchiladas their signature bold and slightly spicy flavor. After baking, the tortillas become tender while the sauce infuses each bite with warmth and depth. Topped with melted cheese, sour cream, and fresh cilantro, enchiladas are a comforting and satisfying dish perfect for any occasion, offering a delicious combination of textures and tastes in every bite.</p>
