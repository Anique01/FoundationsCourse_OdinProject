    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the meat sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it apart with a spoon until browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste, oregano, basil, and canned tomatoes (or passata). If using canned tomatoes, crush them lightly with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar (to balance the acidity of the tomatoes).</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce on low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the béchamel sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir for about 1 minute to make a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking and stirring until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and add a pinch of nutmeg if desired. Remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>If using dried lasagna sheets, cook them according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna sheets over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce, then a few spoonfuls of ricotta.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers (meat sauce, béchamel, ricotta) until you have 3-4 layers, finishing with a layer of béchamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bake:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with foil (to prevent it from drying out) and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
