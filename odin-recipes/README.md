# Odin Recipes

**Project Overview**  
This project, **Odin Recipes**, is part of an assignment designed to practice foundational HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. The website will include an index page linking to individual recipe pages, each containing structured content such as a description, ingredients list, and preparation steps.  

**Skills Demonstrated**  
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:  
- Set up the basic structure of a website using semantic HTML.  
- Use proper HTML boilerplate and organize files/directories for a small web project.  
- Create and link multiple HTML pages within a website.  
- Structure content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.  
- Build a simple navigation system using links and lists.  

This project lays the groundwork for mastering web development fundamentals, which I will build upon as I learn CSS and JavaScript.
