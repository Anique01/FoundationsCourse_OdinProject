### CSS Methods: Exploring Specificity and Rule Order

In this exercise, provided by [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/intro-to-css), I explored the cascade in CSS, focusing on specificity and rule order. This was a unique challenge because, rather than writing new rules, I analyzed and debugged the provided CSS to fix style conflicts and achieve the desired outcome.

### What I Did:
1. Reviewed the HTML and CSS files to identify elements affected by specificity or rule order issues.
2. Edited the CSS file by:  
   - Adding, modifying, or removing selectors to adjust specificity.  
   - Rearranging declaration blocks to ensure the correct styles were applied in the cascade.  
3. Ensured that I did not alter the HTML or change the actual styles within the declaration blocks, focusing solely on resolving conflicts in the CSS.

### What I Learned:
- **Understanding Specificity**: I deepened my understanding of how CSS assigns priority to conflicting rules based on specificity. This included analyzing selectors to determine why certain styles were overriding others and making adjustments to resolve the issues.
  
- **Rule Order Matters**: I learned how the order of declaration blocks in the CSS file impacts the final styles, especially when specificity is equal. This exercise highlighted the importance of writing CSS in a logical and structured way to minimize conflicts.

- **Problem-Solving with the Cascade**: I practiced debugging CSS by identifying why certain rules weren't applying as expected and finding solutions. This experience reinforced how crucial it is to carefully organize styles and understand the hierarchy within CSS.

- **Importance of Valid Selectors**: By ensuring that any selectors I added targeted valid elements in the HTML, I refined my ability to write accurate and efficient CSS.

### Reflection:
This exercise helped me see firsthand how specificity and rule order can influence the cascade in CSS. While it didnâ€™t make me an expert, it gave me valuable insights into avoiding and troubleshooting common issues with the cascade, which is a critical skill for building complex, maintainable stylesheets.
