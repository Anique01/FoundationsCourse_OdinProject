# Class and ID Selectors

In this exercise, I practiced adding class and ID attributes to HTML elements and using their respective selectors in CSS. This helped me understand how to group elements with similar styles using classes and how to uniquely style individual elements with IDs.  

### What I Did  
I analyzed the provided HTML and outcome image to determine which elements needed class attributes, ID attributes, or multiple classes. I then wrote corresponding CSS rules to style these elements. For colors, I used non-keyword values like RGB, HEX, or HSL to enhance my familiarity with these formats.  

The styles I applied included:  
- **All odd-numbered elements**: a light red/pink background and a font family containing `Verdana`, `DejaVu Sans`, and `sans-serif` as a fallback.  
- **The second element**: blue text and a font size of 36px, styled uniquely using an ID.  
- **The third element**: a combination of the odd-numbered element styles plus a font size of 24px, achieved using multiple classes.  
- **The fourth element**: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold text, styled uniquely with an ID.

### What I Learned  
This exercise reinforced my ability to choose between classes and IDs depending on whether styles were shared or unique. I also gained experience assigning multiple classes to elements for more specific styling. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of using proper CSS selector syntax and leveraging various color formats.  

I practiced logical grouping for shared styles, ensuring that similar elements (like odd-numbered paragraphs) shared a class, while unique elements (like the second and fourth) had IDs for individual styling. This approach helped me better understand the organization of styles in a CSS file.  

Finally, I learned to use tools like VS Code's color format conversion feature to experiment with different color representations effectively.
