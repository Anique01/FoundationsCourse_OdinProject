# Methods for Adding CSS

In this exercise, I practiced applying CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. For the external and internal methods, I used type selectors to add styles, and for consistency, I used keyword color values like "red" and "green" instead of RGB or HEX values. This exercise required me to create and link an external CSS file on my own, providing a valuable opportunity to practice getting the syntax right.

I styled three elements, each using a different CSS method:  
- The `div` element was styled with **external CSS**, where I gave it a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, centered and bold text alignment.  
- The `p` element was styled with **internal CSS**, where I applied a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px.  
- The `button` element was styled with **inline CSS**, where I added an orange background and a font size of 18px.

### What I Learned
This exercise taught me the syntax and use cases for each method of applying CSS. I gained confidence in creating and linking an external stylesheet, writing internal CSS within a `<style>` tag, and applying inline CSS directly to an element. I also understood how to prioritize styles and the importance of practice to ensure I can write CSS correctly.

By focusing on the desired outcome and self-checking my progress, I learned to troubleshoot common issues, such as properly linking external files and ensuring styles applied correctly to specific elements.
