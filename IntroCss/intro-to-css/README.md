### Overview of CSS Practice Assignments

In these exercises, provided by [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/intro-to-css), I practiced several key concepts in CSS, focusing on different ways to apply styles to HTML elements. Each exercise built upon the previous one, allowing me to develop a deeper understanding of how to target and style elements efficiently. Here's a summary of what I did and what I learned:

### What I Did:
1. **Methods for Adding CSS**: I practiced using all three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file: external, internal, and inline CSS. I styled different elements with properties like background color, font size, and text alignment, ensuring I applied styles in the correct format for each method.
   
2. **Class and ID Selectors**: I worked with class and ID selectors, adding class and ID attributes to HTML elements and using the correct selector syntax in CSS. I learned how to target groups of elements with classes, as well as apply unique styles using IDs.

3. **Grouping Selectors**: I applied grouping selectors to style multiple elements at once, combining shared styles while still allowing for unique styles where necessary. This helped me reduce redundancy in my code and keep it clean and organized.

4. **Chaining Selectors**: I practiced chaining class selectors to apply unique styles to elements that share a common class. This exercise helped me refine my ability to target specific combinations of classes and apply styles accordingly.

5. **Descendant Combinator**: I explored the descendant combinator to apply styles only to elements that are descendants of a specified parent element. I learned how to target elements based on their hierarchical relationship within the HTML structure, ensuring that styles were applied only to the desired elements.

### What I Learned:
- **CSS Syntax and Selectors**: I reinforced my understanding of different CSS methods and selectors, including class, ID, grouping, and descendant combinators. By practicing these methods, I became more comfortable with writing clean, efficient CSS.
  
- **Targeting Specific Elements**: I learned how to target and style specific elements using different selector strategies, ensuring that styles were applied precisely to the right elements based on their relationships in the HTML document.

- **Using Combinators Effectively**: I deepened my understanding of combinators, particularly descendant and grouping selectors, and how they allow for more efficient, organized code. I practiced applying styles to both shared and unique elements based on their structure.

- **Practical Problem-Solving**: Through each exercise, I developed problem-solving skills by figuring out how to apply the right styles using different methods. I also learned to think critically about how elements are structured in HTML and how to write CSS that targets them effectively.

Overall, these exercises provided me with a solid foundation in CSS, giving me the tools to apply styles in various contexts and helping me improve my skills for future web development projects.
