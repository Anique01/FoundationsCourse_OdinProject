# Grouping Selectors

In this exercise, I built on the previous one by assigning unique class names to two elements and then applying both shared and unique styles to each element. This task helped me further practice using class selectors to style elements in a more efficient way, ensuring that I could group shared styles while keeping unique styles separate.

### What I Did  
I carefully reviewed the outcome image to identify what was shared between the two elements and what was unique to each. I assigned each element a unique class name and then added styles accordingly.  
- **The first element**: I applied a black background and white text.  
- **The second element**: I gave it a yellow background.  
- **Both elements**: I used a font size of 28px and a font list containing `Helvetica` and `Times New Roman`, with `sans-serif` as a fallback. This shared style was applied using a grouping selector, which allowed me to combine the common properties into one rule.

### What I Learned  
This exercise taught me the importance of using grouping selectors to streamline my CSS code, reducing redundancy while still maintaining distinct styles for unique elements. I gained experience in balancing shared and individual styles by using both the grouping selector for common properties and separate rules for element-specific styles. This approach allowed me to apply efficient styling while keeping my code organized and clean.

By assigning unique class names and applying grouping selectors, I also learned how to keep my HTML and CSS more manageable, especially when dealing with similar elements that share most styles but still require some differences.
