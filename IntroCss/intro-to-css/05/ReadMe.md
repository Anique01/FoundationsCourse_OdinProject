# Descendant Combinator

In this exercise, I focused on understanding how the descendant combinator works in CSS. This concept is about applying styles to elements that are nested within another element, while ensuring that elements outside of that hierarchy are not affected by the same styles.

### What I Did  
The task was to apply styles only to the `p` elements that are descendants of a `div` element. I used either type or class selectors (or a combination of both) to target the correct `p` elements. Specifically, I:  
- Applied a yellow background, red text, a font size of 20px, and center alignment to the `p` elements that are within a `div` element.  
- Ensured that `p` elements outside of the `div` element were left unstyled.

### What I Learned  
This exercise helped me grasp how combinators work in CSS, specifically the descendant combinator. I learned how to target elements based on their hierarchy within the HTML structure, which allowed me to apply specific styles only to elements that are children (or deeper descendants) of another element.

By using the descendant combinator, I was able to practice the precision of targeting specific elements in a document structure while ensuring that non-descendant elements remained unaffected. This reinforced the importance of understanding the relationships between elements in an HTML document when writing CSS.
