# Landing Page Project

For this project, I will be creating a landing page based on a design provided by The Odin Project. The goal is to replicate the design exactly as shown in the images provided. This project will help me practice using HTML and CSS to structure and style a web page that mirrors the provided layout and design.

## Project Features

- Replicating the design using HTML5 and CSS3
- Implementing layout elements like headers, sections, and footers
- Following the exact design structure and styling from the provided images
- Using a single stylesheet for all styling

## Design

The project is based on two design images provided by The Odin Project:
- **Image One (Full Design):** Displays the complete layout of the landing page.

- **Image Two (Color and Fonts):** Shows the fonts and color scheme used in the design.

The objective is to replicate the layout, fonts, and colors as closely as possible to match the design in these images.
