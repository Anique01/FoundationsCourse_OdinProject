# Landing Page Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) course. For this assignment, I'll be creating a landing page based on a provided design, using HTML and CSS. The main goal is to put the skills I've learned so far into practice, including structuring content with HTML and styling with CSS.

## Project Features

- Replicating the design using HTML5 and CSS3
- Implementing layout elements like headers, sections, and footers
- Following the design structure and styling from the provided images
- Using a single stylesheet for all styling
- Customizing the content with personal images, text, and experimenting with fonts and colors

## Design

The project is based on two design images provided by The Odin Project:
- **Image One (Full Design):** Displays the complete layout of the landing page.

- **Image Two (Color and Fonts):** Shows the fonts and color scheme used in the design.

The objective is to replicate the layout, fonts, and colors as closely as possible to match the design in these images.

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

*I will edit this section later to reflect any challenges I face during the project and how I resolve them.*

### 1. Navigation Color Matching

### 1. Navigation Color Matching

**Problem:**  
I had trouble figuring out how to get the navigation color to match the provided layout picture more accurately. Initially, I thought it had something to do with opacity.

**Solution:**  
After doing a quick Google search, I found out I could adjust the opacity of the text by using `opacity: ;`. I played around with the different numbers and came out on 0.7. This helped me achieve a closer match to the layoutâ€™s color.
